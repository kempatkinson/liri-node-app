# liri-node-app




To start the app, open the liri-node-app's directory in your cancel and enter "node liri.js" into your console.


This is a simple application that allows a user to look up a band, song, movie, or read a file that has commands to complete any of those operations. It also creates a text file of all the user's history of commands.

Then, select the operation you want to use of the four listed. 

You can look up a band's tour dates, a movie's details, song's information, or a file in the local database.


I used inquirer, fs, moment, and axios packages, while using Spotify, OMBD, and Bands in town API/datbases.

I wrote the code.
